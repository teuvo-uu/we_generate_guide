  abstract = {Wastescapes are the result of unsustainable linear growth processes and their spatial consequences within the context of urban metabolic flows and related infrastructure. They represent the operational infrastructure for waste management and include Drosscapes, generating complex relations with the servicing and surrounding territory. In particular, the peri-urban areas are spatially affected by these processes. This often leads to ineffective use and/or abandonment because they are currently impossible to use, demanding impactful (and often expensive) regeneration and revalorization to make them usable again. Being part of the urban metabolic process, wastescapes are in a continuous state of dynamic equilibrium. They can be considered crucial areas from a metropolitan perspective because they have the potential to become innovative spatial contexts or resources in a Circular Economy (CE), which aims to overcome the crises of both resource scarcity and spatial fragmentation. However, common and shared definitions of wastescapes are still missing at the European policy level, as only classical categories of material waste are generally mentioned. Wastescapes can be considered as `potentiality contexts' where developing, testing, and implementing Eco-Innovative Solutions (EIS) can be done. By doing so, wastescapes can help start transitions towards a CE. This can be achieved by using Peri-urban Living Labs (PULL), which have the potential to be the virtual and physical environments in which experimenting the collaborative co-creation process for developing EIS can be done. Doing so will allow for the improvement of waste management and for the revalorization of wastescapes in collaboration with all potential stakeholders.},

  abstract = {As European governments adopt new circular built environment policies to cope with the socio-ecological crisis, the need for evaluating such policies gains in urgency. Ex post evaluation is, however, difficult as these policies have not been in place long enough to have had significant effects. Nonetheless, ex ante policy evaluation may be possible by assessing policy coherence or the alignment and synergies of policy goals, instruments and implementation practices. This paper proposes a framework to analyse circular built environment policies. This framework is based on a combination of two existing analytical frameworks: circular city development and policy coherence analysis. The framework is tested for the case of a circular built environment in campus development at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, which is regarded as an urban development proxy. Policy documents and semi-structured interviews were analysed and coded. Results confirm previous findings about a prevailing focus on looping actions and indicates limited policy instrumentalisation across governance levels. Identified multilevel (in)coherence in circular city policy is pointed out as consequence of siloed-led and supply chain-based thinking and underdeveloped circular policy frameworks. Finally, the analytical benefits of circular city development and policy coherence frameworks are discussed. Policy relevance Circular economy policies are conceptually limited in delivering a more circular city and built environment. By proposing and testing a circular city policy coherence framework, this article reveals the limited effect of circular economy policies in coping with unsustainable urbanisation. Policymaking and implementation for circularity in the built environment require frameworks that embrace urban complexities instead of reductionist approaches seeing the built environment as a mere agglomeration of supply-chains. Policymakers may use the proposed circular city policy coherence framework as a tool for ex ante policy evaluation in diverse areas of urban development, and specifically for built environment interventions. The combination of both content- and process-based frameworks enables the identification of possible (in)coherence in current and future policy goals, instruments and implementation practices. This can improve policy in early stages of implementation and create more effective policy outputs and outcomes in the long term.},

  abstract = {Material flow accounting (MFA) can be applied to systematically quantify material inputs, outputs and throughputs to and from a geographical area, providing particularly relevant insights into managing resource flows and stocks, and identifying opportunities to close material cycles, moving from a linear to a circular economy. Remarkable advances in recent years have been made on the application of MFA to regions and cities, in particular going beyond material to product flows and providing increased details on life-cycle stages of products across these flows, which are crucial to estimate, understand and manage their associated environmental impacts. This chapter presents an MFA model of the Autonomous Province of Trento (Trentino) in northern Italy, and of the province's capital city Trento. The main purpose is to establish a model to estimate direct material inputs (DMI) and domestic material consumption (DMC) in thousand tonnes per year (reference year 2019), relying on publicly available online data on domestic resource extraction, industrial production, trade, freight transportation and waste generation. The DMC was 12.8 and 13.5 tonnes per capita in the province and in Trento, respectively; the result is below the EU mean of 14.2, but significantly higher than the reported DMC for Italy in the same year of 8.3 tonnes per capita. Accounting and characterizing resource flows associated with urban areas and regions is crucial to increase resource efficiency and mitigate environmental impacts at local, regional and global levels. Advanced detailed MFA models at city and regional levels can inform and support environmentally sustainable planning and policymaking.},

In post-industrial contexts like the Brussels Capital Region (BE), land scarcity and industrial gentrification pose significant challenges for emerging circular activities that do not conform to traditional economic valuation criteria. This article highlights the significance of land as a central resource and contested means for circularity transitions through qualitative research on cases of urban circular economy hubs. We propose a spatial approach for investigating these spaces, examining the influence of regional territorial policies, land value dynamics and the planning system. Resulting from these interplays are diverse forms of circular spatial experimentation, manifesting in three local pathways (i.e. anchoring, transitory and transformative). Public versus private land ownership, stakeholder expectations, and the dual role of public institutions are the primary drivers affecting the durability and socio-economic orientation of circular economy hubs in the city.},

  abstract = {Cities are growing rapidly, and the systems of production and consumption that support this growth are contributing to the depletion of natural resources and pollution of the environment. The circular economy model offers an alternative to the predominant take-make-dispose economic system. Local municipalities are seen to have the capacity to encourage sustainable development of the built environment. This paper aims to explore the role of strategic planning in facilitating a circular economy in urban settings. In particular, this research asks: How are local governments facilitating circular economy initiatives through strategic planning? What are the opportunities and barriers when applying circular economy principles through local strategic planning? The research approach used for this paper is a comparative case study of two international municipalities: the City of Melbourne, Australia and the City of Malm{\"o}, Sweden. Current strategic planning practice was examined with a focus on circular economy themes. The findings reveal that strategic urban planning can translate circular economy objectives into actions within specific urban areas, although barriers still exist to fully integrating the circular economy model.},

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the policies which address circularity at the national level, prior to the implementation of the EU's new CE Action Plan in 2020. As such, this paper presents the institutional starting point of the pathway towards achieving the circularity goals. The policy overview covers 315 policy initiatives, providing the most extensive overview of policies with an impact on the CE. Each policy initiative is categorized on several parameters (e.g., lifecycle phase addressed, policy instruments used) allowing the identification of dominant policy types. Subsequently, the paper presents a co-occurrence analysis by means of a probabilistic model employing combinatorics to determine whether specific policy aspects co-occur more (or less) often together. The analysis finds that the national policy measures focus on a (too) limited number of lifecycle phases and apply a (too) limited set of different instruments to improve circularity. This calls for holistic policy action plans, expanding the focus beyond recycling. Those action plans should consist of several flanking policies and aim for systemic change and circularity throughout the entire lifecycle to improve resource efficiency.},

  abstract = {In a highly urbanised world, cities have become main centers of resource consumption and generation of waste. The notion of the circular economy (CE) identifies strategies for slowing and narrowing resource use through the prevention of waste, improvement of resource use, and substitution of the use of primary resources with recovered materials (and energy). The literature has recently started to explore the concept of circular cities, and a number of cities around the globe have adopted circular economy strategies. Urban regeneration can play a critical role in enabling more circular loops of resources and contribute to more sustainable urban environments; however, there is a lack of contributions in the literature that explore the circularity of urban regeneration projects. The aim of this research is to address this gap by providing a framework and metrics to embed circular economy principles into urban regeneration. The proposed framework and set of metrics are then applied to a case study in West London to quantitatively assess CE implications and point to opportunities to increase circularity. Three main scenarios are developed to assess resource impacts of different waste strategies. The maximizing recycling scenario suggests that over 65\% recycling and just under 35\% energy recovery could be achieved for the area. However, findings suggest potential trade-offs between strategies centered around energy recovery from waste and strategies that prioritise recycling of recyclable fractions from waste. The three scenarios are then assessed against the CE metrics proposed. Again, here, `maximising recycling' better aligns with the proposed CE metrics and contributes to cutting around 50\% of GHG emissions associated with management/disposal of residual waste while increasing opportunities for resource recovery. Finally, some conclusions are drawn pointing to pathways to maximise optimal resource use and infrastructural provision in urban regeneration.},

This is done for helping us to understand better how to manage its process of transition. We will show that CE entails substantial changes in the economic subsystem in terms of adoption of more sustainable models of production and consumption. The CE is a very complex process which take-off is hampered by several barriers also due to the fact that CE belongs to sustainability transitions. On the other hand, the transition to CE is strongly needed and should be accelerated given the dominant and unsustainable linear throughput flow of matter and energy of the global economic system. Finally, we offer a discussion regarding the different approaches, strategies and policy instruments for managing the transition to CE.},

This paper provides further evidence for these critics. The aim of this paper is to create transparency regarding the current understandings of the circular economy concept. For this purpose, we have gathered 114 circular economy definitions which were coded on 17 dimensions. Our findings indicate that the circular economy is most frequently depicted as a combination of reduce, reuse and recycle activities, whereas it is oftentimes not highlighted that CE necessitates a systemic shift. We further find that the definitions show few explicit linkages of the circular economy concept to sustainable development. The main aim of the circular economy is considered to be economic prosperity, followed by environmental quality; its impact on social equity and future generations is barely mentioned. Furthermore, neither business models nor consumers are frequently outlined as enablers of the circular economy. We critically discuss the various circular economy conceptualizations throughout this paper. Overall, we hope to contribute via this study towards the coherence of the circular economy concept; we presume that significantly varying circular economy definitions may eventually result in the collapse of the concept.},

  abstract = {Currently, there are many different interpretations in the literature of what a circular economy is and how it functions. As cities are still facing challenges to become fully sustainable, the need for a comprehensive analysis of how the circular economy can be implemented in urban areas is increasing. This article aims at outlining circular cities by their key characteristics and to further explore and provide a framework for fostering circularity at the city level. In order to achieve this goal, we performed a systematic review and analyzed key papers published in the field of circular economy to determine how circular economy practices form circular cities. We discovered that cities play a focal role in facilitating the transition towards circularity through the closing of the loops, recirculation, technical innovation, policy elaboration and citizens' support. However, city policymakers are still uncertain about how a circular city looks like and what its purpose is, as views are ranging from a strategic ambition to a niche concept of a smart city. Such uncertainty brings challenges, especially in the transition phase that many cities are in at the moment. This further implies that circular economy applied at the urban level still needs effort and innovation to successfully pass the transition phase from the linear economy. Therefore, lastly, we developed a framework model that can be adapted in other cities to facilitate their transition to circular cities.},

Despite their importance, academic scrutiny is lacking. This study critically examines reuse centres as integral components of an evolving community circular economy for the CRD sector. Through expert interviews, we demonstrate how urban reuse centres challenge conventional CRD practices, foster novel engagements with circularity, and navigate frictions in promoting reuse within communities.},

Yet, existing theory and practice struggle to explain how such impacts can be achieved, measured or evidenced. This paper makes two major contributions. Firstly, the paper shows how the Quadruple Helix (QH) innovation approach can be used as the basis for co-producing smart city projects in order to better capture their impacts. In doing so we present a synthesis of current smart city and QH literatures to argue that assessment criteria and indicators must be co-produced with the full set of smart city stakeholders to ensure relevance to context and needs. Secondly, we present an example of a co-produced monitoring and assessment framework and methodology, developed to capture and measure the impacts of smart and sustainable city solutions with the stakeholder teams involved in the European Union Triangulum smart city programme. The paper draws on experiences working with 27 smart city demonstration projects involving public, private and third-sector organisations and communities across Manchester (United Kingdom), Eindhoven (The Netherlands) and Stavanger (Norway). We show how involving QH stakeholders in co-producing impact assessment improves the ability of projects to deliver and measure impacts that matter to cities and citizens. We conclude with a series of lessons and recommendations intended to be of use to the range of organisations and communities currently involved in smart city initiatives across Europe and the world.},

Urban regeneration addresses urban challenges through sustainable and inclusive transformations. Circular makerspaces can support this direction by providing resources for makers and promoting a circular economy, while potentially acting as hubs for circular social innovation. However, to unlock makers' full sustainability potential, makerspaces require business support services that foster entrepreneurial mindsets towards a circular economy. This study uses a mixed-method approach, including action research, surveys, observations and case studies, to analyse the design and implementation of a circular accelerator programme in makerspaces across seven cities in Europe and T{\"u}rkiye, supported with data gathered from 105 makers and 40 projects in circular entrepreneurship. The research suggests potential benefits such as the improvement of entrepreneurial skills, environmental impact awareness, and the enhanced network and collaborations, fostering further opportunities for the development of circular economy. The paper suggests that acceleration programmes via makerspaces focused on circular economy can have multiple benefits for both the makers and their urban context. These findings could support administrators, municipalities, urban planners and policy makers to examine additional ways to support urban regeneration and sustainability.},

We found that political leadership, building adaptable future visions, using experimental approaches (such as living labs), developing contextual knowledge about resource use, and engaging with diverse stakeholders to be important.

  abstract = {Previous studies have paid scarce attention to engagement of various stakeholders in urban development projects. Therefore, this paper examines the possibilities of using digital tools to enhance stakeholder participation in urban development projects and how digital tools may be associated with value creation in the project planning phase. This qualitative case study builds on data we collected through 17 semistructured interviews and participation in four planning workshops in a middle-sized city in Finland. Our data analysis resulted in a categorisation consisting of six types of digital tools that can be used to engage stakeholders in urban development projects. Our results indicate that digital tools provide multiple opportunities for stakeholder participation and that each tool is associated with specific benefits and sacrifices that contribute to value creation. Furthermore, digital tools were found to positively influence project success and stakeholder satisfaction. Our study offers practical recommendations, especially regarding social media, for effectively integrating various stakeholders, including individual citizens and private actors, into urban development projects.},

  abstract = {This article is an intellectual history of two enduring binaries---society-nature and city-countryside---and their co-identification, told through evolving uses of the concept of ``urban metabolism.'' After recounting the emergence of the modern society-nature opposition in the separation of town and country under early industrial capitalism, I interpret ``three ecologies''---successive periods of urban metabolism research spanning three disciplines within the social sciences. The first is the human ecology of the Chicago School, which treated the city as an ecosystem in analogy to external, natural ecosystems. The second is industrial ecology: materials-flow analyses of cities that conceptualize external nature as the source of urban metabolism's raw materials and the destination for its social wastes. The third is urban political ecology, a reconceptualization of the city as a product of diverse socio-natural flows. By analyzing these three traditions in succession, I demonstrate both the efficacy and the limits to Catton and Dunlap's distinction between a ``human exemptionalist paradigm'' and a ``new ecological paradigm'' in sociology.},

  abstract = {A circular approach to the way in which we manage the resources consumed and produced in cities -- materials, energy, water and land -- will significantly reduce the consumption of finite resources globally. It will also help to address urban problems including resource security, waste disposal, greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, heating, drought and flooding. Taking a circular approach can also tackle many other socio-economic problems afflicting cities, for example, providing access to affordable accommodation, expanding and diversifying the economic base, building more engaged and collaborative communities in cities. Thus it has great potential to improve our urban living environments. To date, the industrial ecologists and economists have tended to dominate the circularity debate, focusing on closed-loop industrial systems and circular economy (circular businesses and systems of provision). In this paper I investigate why the current state-of-the-art conceptualisation for circular economy (RESOLVE) is inadequate when applied to a city. Through this critique and a broader review of the literature I identify the principles and components which are lacking from the circular economy (CE) conceptualisation when applied to a city. I then use this to develop my own definition and conceptualisation of a circular approach to urban resource management. {\copyright} Urban Studies Journal Limited 2019.},

  abstract = {With cities striving to meet sustainable development goals, circular urban systems are gaining momentum, especially in Europe.　 This research-based book defines the circular city and circular development. It explains the shift in focus from a purely economic concept, which promotes circular business models in cities, to one that explores a new approach to urban development. This approach offers huge opportunities and addresses important sustainability issues: resource consumption and waste; climate change; the health of urban populations; social inequalities and the creation of sustainable urban economies. It examines the different approaches to circular development, drawing on research conducted in four European cities: Amsterdam, London, Paris and Stockholm. It explores different development pathways and levers for a circular urban transformation. It highlights the benefits of adopting a circular approach to development in cities, but acknowledges that these benefits are not shared equally across society. Finally, it focuses on the challenges to implementing circular development faced by urban actors.　 This ground-breaking book will be essential reading to scholars, students, practitioners and policymakers interested in the circular economy, urban sustainability, urban ecology, urban planning, urban regeneration, urban resilience, adaptive cities and regenerative cities.},
