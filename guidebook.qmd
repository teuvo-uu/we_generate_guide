## **STARTERS: Understanding the Urban Context for Circular Regeneration**

### **Recipe 1: Assessing the Current State: Tools and methods for understanding the existing urban context, including resource flows, waste management systems, and stakeholder mapping in EU cities.**

To effectively integrate circular economy principles into urban regeneration, cities must first develop a comprehensive understanding of their existing urban context. This involves a detailed assessment of resource flows, waste management systems, and the identification and analysis of relevant stakeholders. Several tools and methods have been successfully employed in EU cities to achieve this understanding.

Analyzing resource flows is a critical first step. Material Flow Analysis (MFA) stands out as a key methodology for quantifying and visualizing the intricate web of materials and energy that enter, circulate within, and exit a city [@domenechEmbeddingCircularEconomy2022; @lakatosConceptualizingCoreAspects2021]. This process typically involves four sequential steps: defining the system boundaries, acquiring relevant data, performing calculations to quantify the flows, and interpreting the results, often presented visually through Sankey diagrams [@lakatosConceptualizingCoreAspects2021; @brunnerHandbookMaterialFlow2016]. MFA provides a holistic perspective on a city's metabolism, revealing inefficiencies in resource utilization and highlighting potential avenues for circular interventions. By understanding the volumes and types of resources consumed and the waste generated, cities can strategically target specific areas for improvement within their regeneration projects. For instance, a high volume of construction and demolition waste identified through MFA might suggest a strong focus on material reuse and recycling strategies in upcoming regeneration initiatives [@domenechEmbeddingCircularEconomy2022; @prendevilleCircularCitiesMapping2018].

Building upon the foundation of MFA, the Urban Circularity Assessment (UCA) methods offer a more comprehensive evaluation of a city's circular performance. These methods, such as the one developed within the CityLoops project, not only analyze material flows but also incorporate material stock accounting and circularity indicators [@bellstedtUrbanCircularityAssessment2022a]. UCA provides insights into the accumulation of materials within the urban environment, particularly within the building stock, which is crucial for informing strategies related to adaptive reuse and material recovery during regeneration projects. The practical application of MFA in diverse urban contexts across Europe is exemplified by the REFLOW project, which mapped key material flows in six EU cities, including plastics, textiles, and organic waste, to identify environmental hotspots and potential circular solutions [@REFLOWCocreatingCircular2021]. This demonstrates the adaptability of MFA to various urban settings and priorities.

A thorough analysis of existing waste management systems is equally important. Tools like the Waste Wise Cities Tool (WaCT) and the Municipal Solid Waste Decision Support Tool (MSW DST) offer valuable frameworks for evaluating the performance of urban waste management and identifying areas for enhancement [@takeuchiWasteWiseCities2020; @MunicipalSolidWaste2012; @mugendiReviewToolsFrameworks2023]. Understanding the current waste management infrastructure, its capacity, and its limitations is fundamental for integrating circular economy principles, which aim to minimize waste generation and maximize resource recovery. For example, if a city's recycling infrastructure is inadequate, regeneration projects might need to incorporate localized waste sorting and processing facilities or foster collaborations with existing recycling initiatives. Furthermore, cities must align their waste management assessments and strategies with the overarching framework of the EU's Circular Economy Action Plan and related directives, which set ambitious targets for waste reduction and recycling [@europeancommissionNewCircularEconomy2020]. This alignment is crucial for accessing potential funding and ensuring compliance with European environmental standards.

Finally, successful integration of circular economy into urban regeneration hinges on effective stakeholder engagement, which necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the relevant actors. Stakeholder mapping is an essential process for identifying and analyzing the interests, influence, and potential impact of various individuals, groups, and organizations involved in circular economy initiatives [@undpindonesiaStakeholderMappingCircular2023]. Tools such as power versus interest grids can be effectively used to categorize stakeholders based on their level of influence and their interest in the project [@stockholmenvironmentinsituteMapStakesToolMapping2022]. This understanding allows cities to develop targeted engagement strategies that foster collaboration and ensure the successful adoption of circular practices. Numerous EU initiatives, including the Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI) and the European Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform, underscore the significance of multi-stakeholder collaboration in driving the circular economy transition [@CircularCitiesRegions; @EuropeanCircularEconomy2025]. These platforms offer valuable resources and networks for cities to connect with other stakeholders and learn from established best practices. The DUT Partnership's extensive work on mapping circular urban economy cases across Europe further highlights the diverse range of stakeholders, from grassroots organizations to large corporations, actively contributing to the circular economy within urban environments [@gullstromMappingCircularUrban2024] .

A fundamental aspect that emerges from understanding the urban context is the critical need for comprehensive data on resource flows. The absence of such data can significantly impede the development of effective circular strategies in urban regeneration [@wachsmuthThreeEcologiesUrban2012]. Cities that prioritize and invest in robust data collection and analysis will be far better equipped to implement targeted and impactful interventions. Furthermore, there is a clear trend towards adopting an "urban metabolism" perspective for understanding cities as complex, interconnected systems of resource flows [@wachsmuthThreeEcologiesUrban2012; @lakatosConceptualizingCoreAspects2021]. This holistic view encourages the development of integrated and systemic approaches to urban planning and regeneration, where interventions in one area are considered in relation to their broader impacts. Ultimately, the success of circular urban regeneration is not solely reliant on technological advancements but equally on the active engagement and collaboration of a diverse range of stakeholders [@ghiselliniManagingTransitionCircular2020]. This underscores the importance of fostering social innovation alongside technological solutions to drive meaningful change.

### **Recipe 2: Identifying Opportunities for Circularity: Analyzing the urban context to pinpoint potential areas where circular economy principles can be effectively integrated into regeneration projects.**

Once a city has a thorough understanding of its urban context, the next step is to identify specific opportunities for integrating circular economy principles into urban regeneration projects. This involves analyzing the collected data and engaging with stakeholders to pinpoint areas where circular practices can yield the most significant environmental, social, and economic benefits.

One key area for identifying opportunities lies in recognizing and leveraging overlooked resources, particularly within informal settlements and underutilized urban spaces often referred to as "wastescapes" [@amentaWastescapesCircularLandscapes2018]. Circular development approaches can support urban regeneration by identifying and valuing both the material assets found in these areas, such as polluted land and idle buildings, and the non-material assets, including local knowledge and surplus labour [@domenechEmbeddingCircularEconomy2022] . For example, informal waste management practices prevalent in many urban villages can be recognized, supported, and integrated into more formal systems to enhance resource recovery and create employment opportunities for marginalized communities.

The core principles of the circular economy – eliminating waste and pollution, circulating products and materials at their highest value, and regenerating nature – provide a fundamental framework for identifying circular opportunities within urban regeneration [@ellenmacarthurfoundationCircularEconomyIntroduction; @ellenmacarthurfoundationCitiesCircularEconomy; @ellenmacarthurfoundationBuildingProsperityUnlocking2024; @Kirchherr2017-hc; @bleriot6NaturepositiveCircular2024]. These principles can be applied across various sectors involved in regeneration, including the building and construction sector, waste management, and the local economy. For instance, the principle of circulating products and materials can inspire the creation of material reuse centers within regenerated areas, facilitating the exchange of salvaged building components and other resources [@lynchMaterialCommunitiesUrban]. Similarly, promoting product-as-a-service models for items like tools or appliances can reduce consumption and waste.

The built environment emerges as a particularly critical sector for focusing circular economy efforts in urban regeneration due to its substantial resource consumption and waste generation [@worldgreenbuildingcouncilCircularBuiltEnvironment2023]. Opportunities in this sector include prioritizing the reuse of existing building materials, minimizing construction and demolition waste through efficient design and selective demolition, and enhancing energy efficiency in both new and renovated buildings. By adopting circular strategies in the built environment, cities can significantly reduce the environmental footprint of their regeneration projects. For instance, prioritizing the use of recycled or low-impact materials in construction and renovation can decrease the demand for virgin resources and minimize the embodied carbon associated with buildings [@worldgreenbuildingcouncilCircularBuiltEnvironment2023].

Furthermore, a detailed analysis of a city's urban metabolism can reveal specific resource flows that have a high environmental impact or present significant potential for circularity [@cottinoUrbanRegenerationIncremental2022a]. This data-driven understanding allows for the development of targeted interventions within regeneration projects. For example, if an MFA indicates a large outflow of organic waste, regeneration plans could include the establishment of local composting facilities to produce fertilizer for urban agriculture or biogas plants to generate renewable energy.

The linear "take-make-dispose" economic model has contributed significantly to environmental challenges in urban areas. Urban regeneration offers an opportunity to transition towards a more circular model by consciously redesigning urban systems and infrastructure. This shift not only addresses environmental concerns but also acknowledges the interconnectedness of environmental, social, and economic dimensions in circular urban regeneration [@bourdinCircularitiesTerritoriesOpportunities2022]. It’s not just about reducing waste; it’s also about creating green jobs, fostering social inclusion, and improving the overall quality of life for urban residents. Cities that successfully identify and capitalize on these opportunities for circularity in their regeneration projects can position themselves as leaders in sustainable urban development, attracting investment, talent, and enhancing their global reputation.

### **Recipe 3: Policy and Regulatory Landscape: Understanding the relevant policies and regulations in the EU that enable or hinder the integration of circular economy in urban regeneration.**

Navigating the policy and regulatory landscape is crucial for cities seeking to integrate circular economy principles into their urban regeneration efforts. Understanding the relevant policies at the EU, national, and regional levels can help identify both opportunities and potential barriers to implementing circular practices.

At the European Union level, the Circular Economy Action Plan provides a comprehensive strategic framework for the transition towards a circular economy [@europeancommissionNewCircularEconomy2020; @brusselaersHowCircularEuropean2024]. This plan encompasses various sectors directly relevant to urban regeneration, including construction, waste management, and the design of sustainable products. Cities need to be well-informed about the EU's priorities and targets in these areas to ensure that their local policies and initiatives are aligned and can potentially benefit from EU funding and support. The Action Plan's emphasis on aspects like eco-design, waste prevention, and the promotion of secondary raw materials can guide the development of local regulations and incentives aimed at fostering circular practices within urban regeneration projects.

The EU's Waste Framework Directive is particularly relevant due to its specific targets for the recycling and recovery of construction and demolition waste, a substantial component of urban regeneration activities [@Directive2008982008]. Cities are obligated to implement measures to meet these targets, which may include promoting selective demolition techniques that allow for the separation of materials for higher-quality recycling and reuse, as well as investing in improved waste sorting and processing infrastructure. A clear understanding of the Waste Framework Directive's requirements for C&D waste will directly inform the development of effective waste management protocols for urban regeneration projects.

The EU Urban Agenda also plays a significant role by recognizing the circular economy as a key thematic area for enhancing the quality of life in urban areas [@UrbanAgendaEU; @EuropeanUrbanInitiative]. This initiative encourages cities to identify and implement innovative solutions that promote the reuse, repair, refurbishment, and recycling of existing materials and products. The Urban Agenda serves as a collaborative platform where cities, EU countries, and the European Commission can work together to share knowledge and best practices in integrating circular economy principles into urban contexts. Cities can leverage the partnerships and resources available through the Urban Agenda to gain access to expertise and potential funding opportunities for their circular urban regeneration initiatives.

Beyond the EU level, many member states and regions have developed their own specific circular economy strategies and roadmaps [@prendevilleCircularCitiesMapping2018]. It is essential for cities to understand how these national and regional policies interact with the broader EU framework and how they can be effectively leveraged at the local level. These policies may offer specific targets, funding mechanisms, or regulatory frameworks that directly support circular urban regeneration projects within their jurisdictions. For example, a national policy that incentivizes the use of recycled content in construction materials could create new market opportunities for circular businesses involved in urban regeneration projects within that country.

While the EU provides a general policy direction, the actual integration of circular economy principles into urban regeneration can be complex. There might be a lack of specific top-down tools, requiring a combination of policy support and the fostering of grassroots initiatives. This highlights the need for a balanced approach that combines strategic policy frameworks with the empowerment of local actors to develop tailored solutions that fit their unique urban context. Furthermore, spatial planning is increasingly recognized as a critical tool for enabling the circular economy in urban areas [@ancapiExAntenbspanalysisCircular2023; @baumgartnerFindingLandCircular2024; @calistofriantSustainableCircularCities2023b]. This necessitates a better integration of circular economy principles into urban development plans, zoning regulations, and building codes to facilitate resource reuse, waste reduction, and the growth of circular businesses. Ultimately, policy coherence across all levels of governance – EU, national, regional, and local – is paramount for creating a truly enabling environment for circular urban regeneration [@ancapiExAntenbspanalysisCircular2023]. Inconsistencies or conflicting regulations can create significant barriers and slow down the necessary transition towards a more sustainable and circular urban future.

## **MAIN COURSE: Sparking Change through Circular Initiatives**

### **Recipe 4: Practical Strategies and Pilot Projects: Implementing circular economy strategies in urban regeneration, such as promoting material reuse, reducing construction waste, and fostering local circular businesses.**

To move from understanding the urban context and identifying opportunities to concrete action, cities need to implement practical strategies and pilot projects that embody circular economy principles within their urban regeneration initiatives. This involves a focus on promoting material reuse, actively reducing construction waste, and fostering the growth of local circular businesses.

Promoting the reuse of materials is a cornerstone of a circular approach to urban regeneration. Establishing "urban reuse centres" or "material banks" can serve as vital hubs for collecting, processing, and redistributing salvaged building materials for use in local markets and within regeneration projects [@lynchMaterialCommunitiesUrban; @worldgreenbuildingcouncilCircularBuiltEnvironment2023; @urbactURBACTCitiesAre2024]. The Batitec store in Grenoble, for example, provides a physical space where materials from demolished buildings are sold, inspiring both professionals and citizens to repurpose and reuse these resources [@mellorPleaseReuseYour2022]. These centers not only divert valuable materials from landfills but also make them accessible for reuse, supporting local circular economies and reducing the demand for virgin resources. To maximize the potential of material reuse, implementing pre-demolition audits is crucial [@lynchMaterialCommunitiesUrban; @worldgreenbuildingcouncilCircularBuiltEnvironment2023]. These audits help identify materials within existing buildings that have the potential for reuse, allowing for the application of selective demolition techniques. Unlike conventional demolition, selective demolition involves carefully dismantling buildings to recover high-quality materials, which can then be sorted, stored, and reused in new construction or renovation projects. This process requires specialized expertise and the establishment of efficient systems for material handling and storage. Furthermore, prioritizing the adaptive reuse of existing buildings is a fundamental circular strategy in urban regeneration [@galdiniUrbanReusePractices2019; @baumgartnerFindingLandCircular2024; @ancapiExAntenbspanalysisCircular2023; @worldgreenbuildingcouncilCircularBuiltEnvironment2023]. By giving underutilized or derelict buildings new purposes, cities can significantly reduce the need for new construction, conserve the embodied energy within the existing structures, and often preserve the historical and cultural character of the regenerated area. This requires flexible planning regulations and innovative design approaches that can creatively integrate new uses into existing frameworks.

Actively reducing construction waste is another essential strategy. Implementing robust waste management protocols on construction sites is paramount to ensure that waste materials are properly sorted and a high percentage is recycled [@worldgreenbuildingcouncilCircularBuiltEnvironment2023]. This necessitates clear guidelines for contractors regarding waste segregation, the provision of adequate on-site sorting infrastructure, and regular monitoring of waste streams to track progress and identify areas for improvement. The utilization of digital tools, such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), can also play a significant role in reducing construction waste [@worldgreenbuildingcouncilCircularBuiltEnvironment2023]. BIM allows for more precise design and material estimation, minimizing waste generation during the construction phase. Moreover, BIM can facilitate design for deconstruction, making it easier to recover and reuse building components at the end of the building's lifecycle. Beyond traditional recycling, exploring innovative uses for construction and demolition waste can further minimize landfill disposal. For example, technologies that convert waste minerals from mining into cement offer promising avenues for transforming construction waste into valuable new resources [@yuReimaginingResourcesPolicy2024]. Cities can support research and development in this area and create market demand for such recycled products through their procurement policies.

Finally, fostering the growth of local circular businesses is crucial for creating a sustainable circular economy [@calistofriantSustainableCircularCities2023b; @urbactURBACTCitiesAre2024]. This involves actively supporting the development of businesses that are involved in material reuse, repair, refurbishment, and recycling. By creating a thriving ecosystem of circular enterprises, cities can generate local economic opportunities, enhance urban resilience, and move towards a more sustainable economy. This support can take various forms, including providing business development assistance, facilitating access to funding, and creating enabling regulations that favour circular business models. Establishing "maker spaces" and repair cafes within regenerated areas can also empower citizens to participate in circular practices and directly support local circular businesses [@premyanovCircularEntrepreneurshipMakerspaces2024]. These initiatives promote a culture of repair and reuse, reducing overall consumption and waste while fostering a sense of community. Furthermore, integrating circular economy principles into public procurement policies can create a significant demand for circular products and services, thereby providing a stable market for local circular businesses to grow and thrive [@oppenCircularProcurement82018]. By leveraging their purchasing power, cities can drive the market towards more sustainable and circular solutions, setting an example for the private sector to follow.

The high volume of construction and demolition waste in urban areas presents both a challenge and a significant opportunity for circular economy implementation in regeneration projects [@worldgreenbuildingcouncilCircularBuiltEnvironment2023; @domenechEmbeddingCircularEconomy2022]. Effectively reusing and recycling this waste can lead to substantial environmental and economic benefits. There is a growing trend towards integrating circular economy principles into urban planning from the outset, which is crucial for achieving systemic change [@ancapiExAntenbspanalysisCircular2023; @calistofriantSustainableCircularCities2023b; @baumgartnerFindingLandCircular2024]. Proactively considering circularity in the early stages of planning allows for optimized resource use and minimized waste. Moreover, fostering local circular businesses not only contributes to environmental sustainability but also enhances the social and economic well-being of communities (Premyanov et al., 2024; WorldGBC, 2023), leading to a more resilient and inclusive urban economy [@premyanovCircularEntrepreneurshipMakerspaces2024; @worldgreenbuildingcouncilCircularBuiltEnvironment2023].

### **Recipe 5: Engaging Stakeholders: Methods and tools used in EU cities for effective stakeholder engagement in circular economy initiatives for urban regeneration.**

The successful integration of circular economy principles into urban regeneration projects hinges on the effective engagement of a diverse range of stakeholders. EU cities have employed various methods and tools to foster collaboration, gather input, and build consensus around circular initiatives.

Participatory planning approaches are fundamental to ensuring that urban regeneration projects reflect the needs and aspirations of the local community [@ancapiExAntenbspanalysisCircular2023; @calistofriantSustainableCircularCities2023b; @bolgerCircularCitiesExploring2019; @prendevilleCircularCitiesMapping2018; @williamsCircularCities2019; @williamsCircularCitiesRevolution2021a; @lakatosConceptualizingCoreAspects2021; @bourdinCircularitiesTerritoriesOpportunities2022]. Engaging citizens and community groups in the design and governance of their neighborhoods from the outset fosters a sense of ownership and increases the likelihood of project success. This can be achieved through various means, including public workshops that provide platforms for community members to voice their ideas and concerns in a collaborative setting. Participatory budgeting initiatives, such as OmaStadi in Helsinki, where residents can propose and vote on city-funded projects, are another effective way to involve citizens in shaping their urban environment [@OmaStadi].

Establishing multi-stakeholder platforms and networks is crucial for facilitating collaboration and knowledge exchange among different sectors [@ghiselliniManagingTransitionCircular2020; @calistofriantSustainableCircularCities2023b]. These platforms bring together representatives from government agencies, private businesses, research institutions, and civil society organizations to work towards common goals. The "Barcelona Green Hub," for instance, serves as a network of organizations and businesses dedicated to promoting the circular economy through innovation and collaboration [@mayorsofeuropeCitiesPioneeringCircular2023]. By creating these connections, cities can break down silos, foster trust, and co-create innovative circular solutions for urban regeneration.

Utilizing stakeholder mapping tools is essential for identifying key actors and understanding their interests and influence [@stockholmenvironmentinsituteMapStakesToolMapping2022; @undpindonesiaStakeholderMappingCircular2023]. Tools like power versus interest grids and stakeholder analysis tables help cities visualize the stakeholder landscape and develop targeted engagement strategies. This ensures that the right stakeholders are involved in the process at the appropriate stages and that their perspectives are taken into account.

Employing digital engagement tools can complement traditional methods by broadening participation and reaching a wider audience [@toukolaDigitalToolsStakeholder2022]. Online forums, surveys, and interactive platforms provide accessible channels for citizens to provide input, stay informed about project developments, and contribute to the planning process, regardless of their physical location or time constraints. By combining a variety of online and offline engagement methods, cities can ensure that all segments of the community have the opportunity to participate in shaping the future of their urban environment through circular regeneration.

A significant barrier to adopting circular economy principles can be a lack of effective communication and awareness-raising among stakeholders [@calistofriantSustainableCircularCities2023b]. Cities that prioritize clear and transparent communication strategies are more likely to gain the necessary buy-in and support for their initiatives. There is a growing recognition of the "quadruple helix" approach to stakeholder engagement, emphasizing collaboration between academia, industry, government, and civil society [@paskalevaCoproducingSmartCities2021]. This holistic approach is considered vital for driving the systemic changes required for a successful transition to a circular economy in urban areas. Cities that prioritize meaningful stakeholder engagement in their circular urban regeneration projects are more likely to achieve long-term sustainability and resilience [@calistofriantSustainableCircularCities2023b], as this collaborative approach ensures projects are well-informed, widely supported, and adaptable to future challenges.

### **Recipe 6: Innovative Financing and Business Models: Exploring funding opportunities and sustainable business models that support circular urban regeneration projects.**

Securing adequate financing and adopting sustainable business models are critical for the successful implementation and long-term viability of circular urban regeneration projects. EU cities have explored a range of innovative approaches to address these needs.

Public funding and grants from the EU, such as the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Horizon Europe, as well as various national and regional funding programs, offer significant opportunities to support circular urban regeneration initiatives. Cities need to actively identify and apply for these relevant funding opportunities, ensuring that their project proposals align with the specific criteria and priorities of each program.

Attracting private investment is also essential for scaling up circular urban regeneration. This requires demonstrating the economic viability and potential for long-term financial returns of such projects to private investors [@systemiqUrbanRegenerationTurning2024]. Highlighting the potential for revenue generation through activities like material reuse, energy savings resulting from efficiency measures, and the creation of new circular businesses within the regenerated areas can make these projects more attractive to private capital. Developing clear and compelling business plans that showcase a strong return on investment is key to engaging private sector partners.

Public-private partnerships (PPPs) represent a collaborative model that can effectively leverage the strengths and resources of both the public and private sectors to deliver complex circular urban regeneration projects. The HafenCity project in Hamburg, for example, exemplifies how a well-structured PPP can drive a large-scale, sustainable urban development [@hafencityhamburggmbhHafenCitySustainability]. PPPs can facilitate innovation, share financial risks, and ensure the long-term sustainability of regeneration initiatives. Establishing clear roles, responsibilities, and contractual agreements is crucial for the success of these partnerships.

Promoting circular business models can also create new revenue streams and support the principles of circularity within regenerated areas [@systemiqUrbanRegenerationTurning2024]. Business models based on product-as-a-service, where customers pay for the use of a product rather than owning it, leasing arrangements, sharing platforms that maximize the utilization of resources, and the reuse and remanufacturing of materials can decouple economic activity from the consumption of finite resources and create opportunities for local businesses to thrive. Cities can actively support the adoption of these circular business models through various means, including offering incentives, developing the necessary infrastructure, and conducting awareness campaigns to educate both businesses and consumers.

Overcoming the misconception that urban regeneration is solely a public sector responsibility is crucial for attracting more private investment [@systemiqUrbanRegenerationTurning2024]. Demonstrating the potential for private investors to achieve solid and stable long-term returns in well-planned circular urban regeneration projects is key to unlocking more private capital. The growing recognition of the significant economic benefits of the circular economy, including potential revenue generation, cost savings, and the creation of new jobs, can help make these projects more appealing to both public and private funders. Ultimately, the transition to a circular economy in urban regeneration has the potential to unlock substantial economic opportunities while simultaneously addressing critical environmental and social challenges, creating a more resilient and prosperous urban future.

## **DESSERT: Supporting Structural Change and Long-Term Collaboration**

### **Recipe 7: Embedding Circularity in Policies and Practices: Approaches used in EU cities to support structural change and long-term collaboration among different actors to integrate circular economy into urban regeneration policies.**

To achieve lasting impact, cities need to go beyond individual projects and embed circular economy principles into their broader policies and practices for urban regeneration. This requires a strategic, collaborative, and long-term approach involving various actors.

Developing integrated circular economy strategies and roadmaps is a crucial step towards structural change. Many leading EU cities have already adopted such comprehensive plans to guide their efforts over the long term, explicitly including the integration of circularity into urban regeneration initiatives [@icleiCircularCitiesDeclaration2024]. The experiences of cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen, which were early adopters of circular economy roadmaps, provide valuable lessons for others [@ancapiExAntenbspanalysisCircular2023; @calistofriantSustainableCircularCities2023b]. These strategic documents should articulate a clear vision for a circular urban future, outlining specific goals, measurable targets, and concrete actions across various sectors. The development process should be inclusive, involving relevant stakeholders to ensure broad ownership and alignment.

Establishing effective cross-departmental collaboration within the municipal administration is equally important for a holistic approach to circular urban regeneration [@UrbanAgendaEU; @calistofriantSustainableCircularCities2023b]. Integrating circular economy principles across all relevant departments, including urban planning, economic development, environmental services, and waste management, ensures that these principles are considered in all aspects of regeneration projects. Breaking down traditional silos and fostering communication and cooperation between departments can be facilitated by creating interdepartmental working groups or appointing dedicated circular economy officers responsible for coordinating these efforts.

Building strong and lasting partnerships is essential for driving structural change and fostering long-term collaboration. This involves cultivating relationships between the public sector, private businesses, research institutions, and civil society organizations. These partnerships enable the sharing of diverse knowledge, pooling of resources, and collaborative management of risks, ultimately leading to more sustainable and impactfull outcomes in urban regeneration. Cities can actively facilitate these collaborations through networking events, the development of joint projects, and the establishment of formal agreements that outline the roles and responsibilities of each partner.

Furthermore, embedding circularity directly into urban planning processes is a powerful way to ensure that new developments and regeneration projects consistently align with circular economy goals. This can involve integrating circular principles into spatial plans, updating zoning regulations to favour circular activities, and revising building codes to promote practices like adaptive reuse, the use of recycled and low-impact materials, and design for deconstruction. By making these regulatory changes, cities send a clear signal to developers and investors about their commitment to a circular future and create a level playing field that encourages sustainable practices in urban regeneration.

A significant challenge can be the lack of a cohesive strategic vision, which can result in fragmented and isolated circular economy actions that fail to achieve systemic change [@ghiselliniManagingTransitionCircular2020]. Cities need to prioritize the development of a clear long-term vision for circular urban regeneration and ensure that all individual initiatives are strategically aligned with this overarching goal. The growing emphasis on the role of governance in driving the circular economy transition at the urban level [@calistofriantSustainableCircularCities2023b] underscores the need for cities to take a proactive role in creating an enabling environment that supports the adoption of circular practices by all stakeholders. Ultimately, cities that successfully embed circularity into their policies and practices can create a more resilient, sustainable, and prosperous urban environment for the long term making circular economy principles the standard approach to urban development.

### **Recipe 8: Utilizing Existing Toolkits and Guidance: Reviewing and adapting existing "recipes" or toolkits from EU cities that provide step-by-step guidance for implementing circular economy initiatives in urban settings.**

Cities embarking on the journey of integrating circular economy into urban regeneration can benefit greatly from the wealth of existing toolkits and guidance documents developed by EU cities and organizations. These resources offer practical frameworks, methodologies, and best practices that can be adapted to local contexts.

The Circular City Centre (C3), an initiative of the European Investment Bank (EIB), provides a valuable repository of resources and practical information to support EU cities in their transition to a circular economy [@europeaninverstmentbankCircularCityCentre2025]. C3 offers advisory services and raises awareness about relevant funding opportunities, making it a go-to resource for cities at various stages of their circular journey. Cities can leverage C3's materials to inform the development of their circular city strategies and identify specific actions relevant to urban regeneration.

ICLEI's Circular City Actions Framework provides a practical structure for cities to develop and implement circular economy initiatives [@novakCircularCityActions2022]. The framework outlines five complementary strategies – Rethink, Regenerate, Reduce, Reuse, Recover – that address different aspects of the circular transition in an urban context. Cities can utilize this framework as a guide to ensure their urban regeneration projects align with the core principles of a circular economy and contribute to systemic change.

The Circular Cities Declaration (CCD) Report, a collaborative effort between ICLEI Europe and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, offers a comprehensive assessment of circular economy practices across European cities [@icleiCircularCitiesDeclaration2024]. By analyzing the experiences of numerous signatory cities, the report highlights key trends, showcases exemplary solutions, and identifies common challenges in the implementation of circular economy at the urban level. Cities can learn from the successes and challenges faced by their peers and adapt relevant approaches to their own urban regeneration contexts.

The increasing availability of these toolkits and guidance documents signifies a growing body of knowledge and practical experience in implementing circular economy in urban settings. Cities undertaking circular urban regeneration do not need to reinvent the wheel but can build upon these existing resources. However, it is crucial to recognize that while these toolkits provide valuable frameworks, their effective application requires careful consideration and adaptation to the specific local context. Cities need to tailor these general resources to their unique challenges, opportunities, and stakeholder landscape, taking into account their specific resource flows, waste management systems, and socio-economic conditions. The sharing of these toolkits and best practices across EU cities fosters a collaborative learning environment and accelerates the overall transition towards a circular economy in urban areas.

### **Recipe 9: Addressing Challenges and Mitigating Risks: Identifying potential challenges associated with integrating circular economy into urban regeneration and exploring mitigation strategies.**

Integrating circular economy principles into urban regeneration, while offering numerous benefits, also presents potential challenges and risks that cities need to be aware of and prepared to address.

One common challenge is resistance to change from established industries, businesses, and even citizens who may be accustomed to linear practices. This resistance can manifest as skepticism towards new approaches, reluctance to invest in new technologies or processes, or simply a preference for the status quo. To mitigate this, cities need to engage stakeholders early in the process, clearly communicate the tangible benefits of circularity (environmental, economic, and social), and provide adequate training, education, and support to facilitate the transition.

The inherent complexity of circular economy initiatives, which often involve a wide range of actors with diverse and sometimes conflicting interests, can make stakeholder coordination a significant challenge. Effective mitigation strategies include establishing clear governance structures with defined roles and responsibilities, facilitating regular communication and collaboration through multi-stakeholder platforms, and utilizing stakeholder mapping tools to ensure that all relevant parties are involved and their concerns are addressed.

A lack of expertise and knowledge regarding circular economy principles and their practical application can also hinder integration. Cities can address this by investing in training and capacity-building programs for city staff, local businesses, and the wider community. Partnering with research institutions, universities, and experienced consultants can provide access to specialized knowledge and best practices. Leveraging existing toolkits and guidance documents can also help bridge this knowledge gap.

Financial barriers, particularly the upfront costs associated with transitioning to circular systems and investing in innovative technologies, can be a significant hurdle. To mitigate these barriers, cities need to actively explore various funding opportunities at the local, regional, national, and EU levels. Developing strong business cases that clearly demonstrate the long-term economic benefits of circular initiatives, and exploring innovative financing models such as public-private partnerships, can also help attract the necessary investment.

Existing regulations and policies, often designed for a linear economy, may not always support or may even inadvertently hinder the implementation of circular economy practices. Cities need to engage proactively with policymakers at different levels to advocate for regulatory changes that enable and incentivize circularity. Exploring innovative interpretations of existing regulations and identifying potential policy loopholes that can be leveraged to support circular initiatives can also be effective strategies.

Finally, the lack of reliable data on resource flows and the difficulty in accurately measuring the impact of circular interventions can pose challenges for planning, monitoring, and evaluating progress. Cities need to invest in developing robust data collection and analysis systems, utilizing methodologies like MFA and UCA, and establishing relevant and measurable key performance indicators (KPIs) to track their progress and demonstrate the effectiveness of their circular urban regeneration efforts.

It is important to recognize that purely business or technology centric approaches to the circular economy might not adequately address the complex local specificities that hinder resource recirculation. A more context-specific and socially inclusive approach is often necessary for successful integration in urban regeneration. Cities also need to be aware of potential trade-offs between different circular economy strategies and carefully assess these trade-offs to choose the most appropriate solutions for their local context and sustainability goals. Addressing these challenges and mitigating the associated risks requires a long-term commitment, a willingness to adapt and learn from experience, and a collaborative approach involving all relevant stakeholders.

### **Recipe 10: Measuring Impact and Success: Guidance on measuring the impact and success of circular economy interventions in urban regeneration projects.**

To ensure accountability and demonstrate the value of their efforts, cities need to establish effective methods for measuring the impact and success of circular economy interventions in urban regeneration projects. This involves tracking progress towards defined goals and evaluating the overall effectiveness of implemented strategies.

Developing clear and measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) is a fundamental step. These KPIs should be directly aligned with the specific objectives of the regeneration project and the overarching principles of the circular economy. They should cover a range of aspects, including environmental outcomes such as reductions in waste generation, increases in material reuse and recycling rates, and improvements in energy efficiency. Social indicators might include job creation in circular economy sectors and enhanced community well-being. Economic KPIs could track cost savings from resource efficiency measures and the growth of local circular businesses. Well-defined KPIs allow cities to monitor their progress over time, evaluate the effectiveness of different interventions, and communicate the results to stakeholders in a transparent manner.

Utilizing Material Flow Analysis (MFA) provides a valuable tool for measuring the impact on resource flows. By conducting MFAs before and after the implementation of circular economy interventions in urban regeneration areas, cities can quantitatively assess the changes in resource consumption and waste generation. This data-driven approach provides concrete evidence of the effectiveness of strategies aimed at closing material loops and improving resource efficiency.

Conducting Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) can offer a more comprehensive understanding of the environmental impacts of circular economy strategies. LCA involves evaluating the environmental burdens associated with a product, process, or service throughout its entire lifecycle, from the extraction of raw materials to its end-of-life management. By applying LCA to different circular economy interventions within urban regeneration projects, cities can identify the most sustainable options and avoid unintended negative environmental consequences. For example, an LCA could compare the environmental benefits of using recycled versus virgin materials in construction.

Beyond environmental metrics, it is crucial to measure the broader social and economic impacts of circular urban regeneration. This includes assessing the number of jobs created in new circular economy businesses, evaluating improvements in community well-being through surveys and other data collection methods, and tracking the economic performance of local enterprises that have adopted circular practices. A holistic assessment of impact ensures that circular urban regeneration contributes to the wider goals of sustainable development, encompassing environmental protection, social equity, and economic prosperity.

A challenge in measuring the success of circular economy initiatives is the current lack of common metrics across different cities and regions. This can hinder the comparability of results and make it difficult for cities to learn from each other's experiences. Working towards the development and adoption of common circular economy metrics at the EU level would greatly facilitate knowledge sharing and accelerate the overall transition. There is also a growing recognition of the need to shift the focus from solely measuring downstream activities like recycling to setting more ambitious targets related to upstream material use and consumption-based emissions. This reflects a more comprehensive understanding of the systemic changes required for a truly circular economy. Ultimately, transparently measuring and reporting on the impact of circular urban regeneration projects is essential for building trust with stakeholders, demonstrating accountability for public funds, and making a strong case for continued investment in these transformative initiatives. This data-driven approach will help to scale up successful interventions and drive further progress towards a more circular and sustainable urban future.

## **Conclusions**

Integrating circular economy principles into urban regeneration offers a powerful pathway for cities to achieve more sustainable, resilient, and liveable urban environments. By adopting a structured approach that begins with a thorough understanding of the local context, identifies opportunities for circularity, navigates the policy landscape, implements practical strategies, engages stakeholders effectively, and secures innovative financing, cities can successfully spark change. Embedding circularity into long-term policies and practices, leveraging existing knowledge and tools, addressing potential challenges proactively, and rigorously measuring impact are crucial for ensuring the lasting success of these initiatives. The experiences of pioneering EU cities provide valuable models and lessons learned that can guide others on this transformative journey towards a circular urban future.
